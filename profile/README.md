**All-in-one Gaming Utility for Scaling and Frame Generation**

## What is Lossless Scaling?

**Lossless Scaling** allows you to scale windowed games to full screen using state-of-the-art scaling algorithms. It also provides machine learning-based proprietary scaling and frame generation capabilities.

### Frame Generation Options:
- **LSFG**

### Scaling Options:
- **LS1**
- **AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution**
- **NVIDIA Image Scaling**
- **Integer Scaling**
- **Nearest Neighbor**
- **xBR**
- **Anime4K**
- **Sharp Bilinear**
- **Bicubic CAS**

---

The latest feature allows you to use Lossless Scaling to **generate additional frames** in games that do not natively support frame generation, including emulators.

Lossless Scaling is also useful for:
- **Upscaling modern games** when you cannot run them at native screen resolution (GPU limited), helping eliminate blur from bilinear scaling by the GPU driver.
- **Upscaling older and pixel-art games** that do not support modern screen resolutions or full screen mode.

---

### Recommended Settings

- For **modern games**, use:  
  `LS1` or `AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR)`

- For **pixel-art games**, use:  
  `Integer Scaling` or `xBR`

- For **cartoons or anime**, use:  
  `Anime4K`

## Requirements

- **Scaling is useful when GPU power is the limiting factor.**  
  For optimal performance, **cap the game's frame rate** to ensure Lossless Scaling has enough resources to function effectively.

- The game **must be running in windowed mode**

- Requires **Windows 10 version 1903 or newer**
